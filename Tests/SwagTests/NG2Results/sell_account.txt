The method's response includes a rateTableId for each table defined by the seller. Use a table's ID value in a fulfillment policy to specify the shipping rate table to use for that policy's DOMESTIC or INTERNATIONAL shipping option (make sure the locality of the rate table matches the optionType of the shipping option). Sellers can define up to 40 shipping rate tables for their account, which lets them set up different rate tables for each of the marketplaces they sell into. Go to My eBay &gt; Account &gt; Site Preferences to create and maintain the rate tables. For more, see Using shipping rate tables. If you're using the Trading API, use the rate table ID values in the RateTableDetails container of the Add/Revise/Relist calls. If the locality for a rate table is set to DOMESTIC, pass the ID value in the RateTableDetails.DomesticRateTableId field. Otherwise, if locality is INTERNATIONAL, pass the ID value in RateTableDetails.InternationalRateTableId. Note: For regions that are not yet ramped up with multi-rate table support, this method returns an ID that maps to the seller's default rate table for the country specified. Currently, only the US and AU marketplaces support the extended multi-rate table functionality.
