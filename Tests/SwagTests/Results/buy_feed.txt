For details, see Feed File Filters. When curating the items returned, be sure to code as if these filters are not applied as they can be changed or removed in the future. URLs for this method Production URL: https://api.ebay.com/buy/feed/v1_beta/ Sandbox URL: https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/buy/feed/v1_beta/ Downloading feed files Item feed files are binary gzip files. If the file is larger than 100 MB, the download must be streamed in chunks. You specify the size of the chunks in bytes using the Range request header. The Content-range response header indicates where in the full resource this partial chunk of data belongs and the total number of bytes in the file. For more information about using these headers, see Retrieving a gzip feed file. In addition to the API, there is an open source Feed SDK written in Java that downloads, combines files into a single file when needed, and unzips the entire feed file. It also lets you specify field filters to curate the items in the file. Note: The response is always a TSV_GZIP file. However for documentation purposes, the response is shown as JSON fields so that the value returned in each column can be explained. The order of the response fields, shows you the order of the columns in the feed file. Restrictions For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, see API Restrictions.
