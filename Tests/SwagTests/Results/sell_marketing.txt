The report is generated based on the criteria you specify, including the report type, the report's dimensions and metrics, the report's start and end dates, the listings to include in the report, and more. Metrics are the quantitative measurements in the report while dimensions specify the attributes of the data included in the reports. For details on the required and optional fields for each report type, see Creating Promoted Listings reports. This call returns the URL to the report task in the Location response header, and the URL includes the report-task ID. Reports often take time to generate and it's common for this call to return an HTTP status of 202, which indicates the report is being generated. Call getReportTasks (or getReportTask with the report-task ID) to determine the status of a Promoted Listings report. When a report is complete, eBay sets its status to SUCCESS and you can download it using the URL returned in the reportHref field of the getReportTask call. Report files are tab-separated value gzip files with a file extension of .tsv.gz. Note: This call fails if you don't submit all the required fields for the specified report type. Fields not supported by the specified report type are ignored. Call getReportMetadata to retrieve a list of the fields you need to configure for each Promoted Listings report type.

Discounts can be specified as either a monetary amount or a percentage off the standard sales price. eBay highlights promoted items by placing teasers for the items throughout the online sales flows. Unlike an item promotion, a markdown promotion does not require the buyer meet a &quot;threshold&quot; before the offer takes effect. With markdown promotions, all the buyer needs to do is purchase the item to receive the promotion benefit. Important: You can create item price markdown promotions only for specific listings. For complete details, see Promotions Manager requirements and restrictions. In addition, we recommend you list items at competitive prices before including them in your markdown promotions. For an extensive list of pricing recommendations, see the Growth tab in Seller Hub. There are two ways to add items to markdown promotions: Key-based promotions select items using either the listing IDs or inventory reference IDs of the items you want to promote. Note that if you use inventory reference IDs, you must specify both the inventoryReferenceId and the associated inventoryReferenceType of the item(s) you want to include the promotion. Rule-based promotions select items using a list of eBay category IDs or seller Store category IDs. Rules can further constrain items in a promotion by minimum and maximum prices, brands, and item conditions. New promotions must be created in either a DRAFT or a SCHEDULED state. Use the DRAFT state when you are initially creating a promotion and you want to be sure it's correctly configured before scheduling it to run. When you create a promotion, the promotion ID is returned in the Location response header. Use this ID to reference the promotion in subsequent requests (such as to schedule a promotion that's in a DRAFT state). Tip: Refer to Promotions Manager in the Selling Integration Guide for details and examples showing how to create and manage seller promotions. Markdown promotions are available on all eBay marketplaces. For more information, see Promotions Manager requirements and restrictions.

When updating a promotion, supply all the fields that you used to configure the original promotion (and not just the fields you are updating). eBay replaces the specified promotion with the values you supply in the update request and if you don't pass a field that currently has a value, the update request will fail. The parameters you are allowed to update with this request depend on the status of the promotion you're updating: DRAFT or SCHEDULED promotions: You can update any of the parameters in these promotions that have not yet started to run, including the discountRules. RUNNING or PAUSED promotions: You can change the endDate and the item's inventory but you cannot change the promotional discount or the promotion's start date. ENDED promotions: Nothing can be changed. Tip: When updating a RUNNING or PAUSED promotion, set the status field to SCHEDULED for the update request. When the promotion is updated, the previous status (either RUNNING or PAUSED) will be reset.
