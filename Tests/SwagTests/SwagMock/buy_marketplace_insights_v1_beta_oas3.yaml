      description: '(Limited Release) This method searches for sold eBay items by various URI query parameters and retrieves the sales history of the items for the last 90 days. You can search by keyword, category, eBay product ID (ePID), or GTIN, or a combination of these. This method also supports the following: Filtering by the value of one or multiple fields, such as listing format, item condition, price range, location, and more. For the fields supported by this method, see the filter parameter. Retrieving the refinements (metadata) of an item , such as item aspects (color, brand), condition, category, etc. using the fieldgroups parameter. Filtering by item aspects and other refinements using the aspect_filter parameter. Creating aspects histograms, which enables shoppers to drill down in each refinement narrowing the search results. For details and examples of these capabilities, see Browse API in the Buying Integration Guide. Pagination and sort controls There are pagination controls (limit and offset fields) and sort query parameters that control/sort the data that is returned. By default, the results are sorted by &quot;Best Match&quot;. For more information about Best Match, see the eBay help page Best Match. URLs for this method Production URL: https://api.ebay.com/buy/marketplace_insights/v1_beta/item_sales/ Sandbox URL: https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/buy/marketplace_insights/v1_beta/item_sales/ Request headers You will want to use the X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header with this method. If you are an eBay Network Partner you must use affiliateCampaignId=ePNCampaignId,affiliateReferenceId=referenceId in the header in order to be paid for selling eBay items on your site . For details see, Request headers in the Buy APIs Overview. URL Encoding for Parameters Query parameter values need to be URL encoded. For details, see URL encoding query parameter values. Restrictions For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, see API Restrictions.'
