To determine the number of pages in a result set, divide the total value (total number of monetary transactions matching input criteria) by this limit value, and then round up to the next integer. For example, if the total value was 120 (120 total monetary transactions) and the limit value was 50 (show 50 monetary transactions per page), the total number of pages in the result set is three, so the seller would have to make three separate getTransactions calls to view all monetary transactions matching the input criteria.
