      description: 'Use this call to create a new inventory location. In order to create and publish an offer (and create an eBay listing), a seller must have at least one inventory location, as every offer must be associated with a location. Upon first creating an inventory location, only a seller-defined location identifier and a physical location is required, and once set, these values can not be changed. The unique identifier value (merchantLocationKey) is passed in at the end of the call URI. This merchantLocationKey value will be used in other Inventory Location calls to identify the inventory location to perform an action against. At this time, location types are either warehouse or store. Warehouse locations are used for traditional shipping, and store locations are generally used by US merchants selling products through the In-Store Pickup program, or used by UK, Australian, and German merchants selling products through the Click and Collect program. A full address is required for store inventory locations. However, for warehouse inventory locations, a full street address is not needed, but the city, state/province, and country of the location must be provided. Note that all inventory locations are &quot;enabled&quot; by default when they are created, and you must specifically disable them (by passing in a value of DISABLED in the merchantLocationStatus field) if you want them to be set to the disabled state. The seller''s inventory cannot be loaded to inventory locations in the disabled state. In addition to the authorization header, which is required for all eBay REST API calls, the following table includes another request header that is mandatory for the createInventoryLocation call, and two other request headers that are optional: Header Description Required? Applicable Values Accept Describes the response encoding, as required by the caller. Currently, the interfaces require payloads formatted in JSON, and JSON is the default. No application/json Content-Language Use this header to control the language that is used for any returned errors or warnings in the call response. No en-US Content-Type The MIME type of the body of the request. Must be JSON. Yes application/json Unless one or more errors and/or warnings occur with the call, there is no response payload for this call. A successful call will return an HTTP status value of 204 No Content.'

      description: 'Note: Please note that any eBay listing created using the Inventory API cannot be revised or relisted using the Trading API calls. This call creates a new inventory item record or replaces an existing inventory item record. It is up to sellers whether they want to create a complete inventory item record right from the start, or sellers can provide only some information with the initial createOrReplaceInventoryItem call, and then make one or more additional createOrReplaceInventoryItem calls to complete all required fields for the inventory item record and prepare it for publishing. Upon first creating an inventory item record, only the SKU value in the call path is required. In the case of replacing an existing inventory item record, the createOrReplaceInventoryItem call will do a complete replacement of the existing inventory item record, so all fields that are currently defined for the inventory item record are required in that update action, regardless of whether their values changed. So, when replacing/updating an inventory item record, it is advised that the seller run a getInventoryItem call to retrieve the full inventory item record and see all of its current values/settings before attempting to update the record. And if changes are made to an inventory item that is part of one or more active eBay listings, a successful call will automatically update these eBay listings. The key information that is set with the createOrReplaceInventoryItem call include: Seller-defined SKU value for the product. Each seller product, including products within an item inventory group, must have their own SKU value. This SKU value is passed in at the end of the call URI Condition of the item Product details, including any product identifier(s), such as a UPC, ISBN, EAN, or Brand/Manufacturer Part Number pair, a product description, a product title, product/item aspects, and links to images. eBay will use any supplied eBay Product ID (ePID) or a GTIN (UPC, ISBN, or EAN) and attempt to match those identifiers to a product in the eBay Catalog, and if a product match is found, the product details for the inventory item will automatically be populated. Quantity of the inventory item that is available for purchase Package weight and dimensions, which is required if the seller will be offering calculated shipping options. The package weight will also be required if the seller will be providing flat-rate shipping services, but charging a weight surcharge. In addition to the authorization header, which is required for all eBay REST API calls, the createOrReplaceInventoryItem call also requires the Content-Language header, that sets the natural language that will be used in the field values of the request payload. For US English, the code value passed in this header should be en-US. To view other supported Content-Language values, and to read more about all supported HTTP headers for eBay REST API calls, see the HTTP request headers topic in the Using eBay RESTful APIs document. For those who prefer to create or update numerous inventory item records with one call (up to 25 at a time), the bulkCreateOrReplaceInventoryItem method can be used.'

      description: 'This call is used by the seller to update the total ship-to-home quantity of one inventory item, and/or to update the price and/or quantity of one or more offers associated with one inventory item. Up to 25 offers associated with an inventory item may be updated with one bulkUpdatePriceQuantity call. Only one SKU (one product) can be updated per call. The getOffers call can be used to retrieve all offers associated with a SKU. The seller will just pass in the correct SKU value through the sku query parameter. To update an offer, the offerId value is required, and this value is returned in the getOffers call response. It is also useful to know which offers are unpublished and which ones are published. To get this status, look for the status value in the getOffers call response. Offers in the published state are live eBay listings, and these listings will be revised with a successful bulkUpdatePriceQuantity call. An issue will occur if duplicate offerId values are passed through the same offers container, or if one or more of the specified offers are associated with different products/SKUs. Note: For multiple-variation listings, it is recommended that the bulkUpdatePriceQuantity call be used to update price and quantity information for each SKU within that multiple-variation listing instead of using createOrReplaceInventoryItem calls to update the price and quantity for each SKU. Just remember that only one SKU (one product variation) can be updated per call. The authorization header is the only required HTTP header for this call. See the HTTP request headers section for more information.'

      description: 'Note: Please note that any eBay listing created using the Inventory API cannot be revised or relisted using the Trading API calls. This call can be used to create and/or update up to 25 new inventory item records. It is up to sellers whether they want to create a complete inventory item records right from the start, or sellers can provide only some information with the initial bulkCreateOrReplaceInventoryItem call, and then make one or more additional bulkCreateOrReplaceInventoryItem calls to complete all required fields for the inventory item records and prepare for publishing. Upon first creating inventory item records, only the SKU values are required. In the case of updating existing inventory item records, the bulkCreateOrReplaceInventoryItem call will do a complete replacement of the existing inventory item records, so all fields that are currently defined for the inventory item record are required in that update action, regardless of whether their values changed. So, when replacing/updating an inventory item record, it is advised that the seller run a ''Get'' call to retrieve the full details of the inventory item records and see all of its current values/settings before attempting to update the records. Any changes that are made to inventory item records that are part of one or more active eBay listings, a successful call will automatically update these active listings. The key information that is set with the bulkCreateOrReplaceInventoryItem call include: Seller-defined SKU value for the product. Each seller product, including products within an item inventory group, must have their own SKU value. Condition of the item Product details, including any product identifier(s), such as a UPC, ISBN, EAN, or Brand/Manufacturer Part Number pair, a product description, a product title, product/item aspects, and links to images. eBay will use any supplied eBay Product ID (ePID) or a GTIN (UPC, ISBN, or EAN) and attempt to match those identifiers to a product in the eBay Catalog, and if a product match is found, the product details for the inventory item will automatically be populated. Quantity of the inventory item that is available for purchase Package weight and dimensions, which is required if the seller will be offering calculated shipping options. The package weight will also be required if the seller will be providing flat-rate shipping services, but charging a weight surcharge. In addition to the authorization header, which is required for all eBay REST API calls, the bulkCreateOrReplaceInventoryItem call also requires the Content-Language header, that sets the natural language that will be used in the field values of the request payload. For US English, the code value passed in this header should be en-US. To view other supported Content-Language values, and to read more about all supported HTTP headers for eBay REST API calls, see the HTTP request headers topic in the Using eBay RESTful APIs document. For those who prefer to create or update a single inventory item record, the createOrReplaceInventoryItem method can be used.'

An existing offer may be in published state (active eBay listing), or in an unpublished state and yet to be published with the publishOffer call. The unique identifier (offerId) for the offer to update is passed in at the end of the call URI. The updateOffer call does a complete replacement of the existing offer object, so all fields that make up the current offer object are required, regardless of whether their values changed. Other information that is required before an unpublished offer can be published or before a published offer can be revised include: Inventory location Offer price Available quantity eBay listing category Referenced listing policy profiles to set payment, return, and fulfillment values/settings For published offers, the listingDescription field is also required to update the offer/eBay listing. For unpublished offers, this field is not necessarily required unless it is already set for the unpublished offer. In addition to the authorization header, which is required for all eBay REST API calls, the updateOffer call also requires the Content-Language header, that sets the natural language that will be used in the field values of the request payload. For US English, the code value passed in this header should be en-US. To view other supported Content-Language values, and to read more about all supported HTTP headers for eBay REST API calls, see the HTTP request headers topic in the Using eBay RESTful APIs document.'

This call is used to convert all unpublished offers associated with an inventory item group into an active, multiple-variation listing. The unique identifier of the inventory item group (inventoryItemGroupKey) is passed in the request payload. All inventory items and their corresponding offers in the inventory item group must be valid (meet all requirements) for the publishOfferByInventoryItemGroup call to be completely successful. For any inventory items in the group that are missing required data or have no corresponding offers, the publishOfferByInventoryItemGroup will create a new multiple-variation listing, but any inventory items with missing required data/offers will not be in the newly-created listing. If any inventory items in the group to be published have invalid data, or one or more of the inventory items have conflicting data with one another, the publishOfferByInventoryItemGroup call will fail. Be sure to check for any error or warning messages in the call response for any applicable information about one or more inventory items/offers having issues.'

      description: 'This call creates multiple offers (up to 25) for specific inventory items on a specific eBay marketplace. Although it is not a requirement for the seller to create complete offers (with all necessary details) right from the start, eBay recommends that the seller provide all necessary details with this call since there is currently no bulk operation available to update multiple offers with one call. The following fields are always required in the request payload: sku, marketplaceId, and (listing) format. Other information that will be required before a offer can be published are highlighted below: Inventory location Offer price Available quantity eBay listing category Referenced listing policy profiles to set payment, return, and fulfillment values/settings If the call is successful, unique offerId values are returned in the response for each successfully created offer. The offerId value will be required for many other offer-related calls. Note that this call only stages an offer for publishing. The seller must run either the publishOffer, bulkPublishOffer, or publishOfferByInventoryItemGroup call to convert offer(s) into an active single- or multiple-variation listing. In addition to the authorization header, which is required for all eBay REST API calls, the bulkCreateOffer call also requires the Content-Language header, that sets the natural language that will be used in the field values of the request payload. For US English, the code value passed in this header should be en-US. To view other supported Content-Language values, and to read more about all supported HTTP headers for eBay REST API calls, see the HTTP request headers topic in the Using eBay RESTful APIs document. For those who prefer to create a single offer per call, the createOffer method can be used instead.'

      description: 'This call creates a new inventory item group or updates an existing inventory item group. It is up to sellers whether they want to create a complete inventory item group record right from the start, or sellers can provide only some information with the initial createOrReplaceInventoryItemGroup call, and then make one or more additional createOrReplaceInventoryItemGroup calls to complete the inventory item group record. Upon first creating an inventory item group record, the only required elements are the inventoryItemGroupKey identifier in the call URI, and the members of the inventory item group specified through the variantSKUs array in the request payload. In the case of updating/replacing an existing inventory item group, this call does a complete replacement of the existing inventory item group record, so all fields (including the member SKUs) that make up the inventory item group are required, regardless of whether their values changed. So, when replacing/updating an inventory item group record, it is advised that the seller run a getInventoryItemGroup call for that inventory item group to see all of its current values/settings/members before attempting to update the record. And if changes are made to an inventory item group that is part of a live, multiple-variation eBay listing, these changes automatically update the eBay listing. For example, if a SKU value is removed from the inventory item group, the corresponding product variation will be removed from the eBay listing as well. In addition to the required inventory item group identifier and member SKUs, other key information that is set with this call include: Title and description of the inventory item group. The string values provided in these fields will actually become the listing title and listing description of the listing once the first SKU of the inventory item group is published successfully Common aspects that inventory items in the qroup share Product aspects that vary within each product variation Links to images demonstrating the variations of the product, and these images should correspond to the product aspect that is set with the variesBy.aspectsImageVariesBy field In addition to the authorization header, which is required for all eBay REST API calls, the createOrReplaceInventoryItemGroup call also requires the Content-Language header, that sets the natural language that will be used in the field values of the request payload. For US English, the code value passed in this header should be en-US. To view other supported Content-Language values, and to read more about all supported HTTP headers for eBay REST API calls, see the HTTP request headers topic in the Using eBay RESTful APIs document.'

      description: 'This call is used to convert existing eBay Listings to the corresponding Inventory API objects. If an eBay listing is successfully migrated to the Inventory API model, new Inventory Location, Inventory Item, and Offer objects are created. For a multiple-variation listing that is successfully migrated, in addition to the three new Inventory API objects just mentioned, an Inventory Item Group object will also be created. If the eBay listing is a motor vehicle part or accessory listing with a compatible vehicle list (ItemCompatibilityList container in Trading API''s Add/Revise/Relist/Verify calls), a Product Compatibility object will be created. Migration Requirements To be eligible for migration, the active eBay listings must meet the following requirements: Listing type is Fixed-Price Listing duration is ''GTC'' (Good ''til Cancelled) The item(s) in the listings must have seller-defined SKU values associated with them, and in the case of a multiple-variation listing, each product variation must also have its own SKU value Business Polices (Payment, Return Policy, and Shipping) must be used on the listing, as legacy payment, return policy, and shipping fields will not be accepted. With the Payment Policy associated with a listing, the immediate payment requirement must be enabled, and the only accepted payment method should be PayPal The postal/zip code (PostalCode field in Trading''s ItemType) or city (Location field in Trading''s ItemType) must be set in the listing; the country is also needed, but this value is required in Trading API, so it will always be set for every listing Unsupported Listing Features The following features are not yet available to be set or modified through the Inventory API, but they will remain on the active eBay listing, even after a successful migration to the Inventory model. The downside to this is that the seller will be completely blocked (in APIs or My eBay) from revising these features/settings once the migration takes place: Best Offer settings, including the Best Offer Auto Accept and Auto Reject price thresholds Any listing-level Buyer Requirements Charity donations from sale proceeds Listing Designer Template applied to the listing Listing enhancements like a bold listing title or Gallery Plus Listing in two categories (secondary category) Making the Call In the request payload of the bulkMigrateListings call, the seller will pass in an array of one to five eBay listing IDs (aka Item IDs). To save time and hassle, that seller should do a pre-check on each listing to make sure those listings meet the requirements to be migrated to the new Inventory model. There are no path or query parameters for this call. Call Response If an eBay listing is migrated successfully to the new Inventory model, the following will occur: An Inventory Item object will be created for the item(s) in the listing, and this object will be accessible through the Inventory API An Offer object will be created for the listing, and this object will be accessible through the Inventory API An Inventory Location object will be created and associated with the Offer object, as an Inventory Location must be associated with a published OfferThe response payload of the Bulk Migrate Listings call will show the results of each listing migration. These results include an HTTP status code to indicate the success or failure of each listing migration, the SKU value associated with each item, and if the migration is successful, an Offer ID value. The SKU value will be used in the Inventory API to manage the Inventory Item object, and the Offer ID value will be used in the Inventory API to manage the Offer object. Errors and/or warnings containers will be returned for each listing where an error and/or warning occurred with the attempted migration. If a multiple-variation listing is successfully migrated, along with the Offer and Inventory Location objects, an Inventory Item object will be created for each product variation within the listing, and an Inventory Item Group object will also be created, grouping those variations together in the Inventory API platform. For a motor vehicle part or accessory listing that has a specified list of compatible vehicles, in addition to the Inventory Item, Inventory Location, and Offer objects that are created, a Product Compatibility object will also be created in the Inventory API platform.'

HTML tags and markup can be used in listing descriptions, but each character counts toward the max length limit. Note: To ensure that their short listing description is optimized when viewed on mobile devices, sellers should strongly consider using eBay''s View Item description summary feature when listing their items. Keep in mind that the ''short'' listing description is what prospective buyers first see when they view the listing on a mobile device. The ''full'' listing description is also available to mobile users when they click on the short listing description, but the full description is not automatically optimized for viewing in mobile devices, and many users won''t even drill down to the full description. Using HTML div and span tag attributes, this feature allows sellers to customize and fully control the short listing description that is displayed to prospective buyers when viewing the listing on a mobile device. The short listing description on mobile devices is limited to 800 characters, and whenever the full listing description (provided in this field, in UI, or seller tool) exceeds this limit, eBay uses a special algorithm to derive the best possible short listing description within the 800-character limit. However, due to some short listing description content being removed, it is definitely not ideal for the seller, and could lead to a bad buyer experience and possibly to a Significantly not as described (SNAD) case, since the buyer may not get complete details on the item when viewing the short listing description. See the eBay help page for more details on using the HTML div and span tags.

HTML tags and markup can be used in listing descriptions, but each character counts toward the max length limit. Note: To ensure that their short listing description is optimized when viewed on mobile devices, sellers should strongly consider using eBay''s View Item description summary feature when listing their items. Keep in mind that the ''short'' listing description is what prospective buyers first see when they view the listing on a mobile device. The ''full'' listing description is also available to mobile users when they click on the short listing description, but the full description is not automatically optimized for viewing in mobile devices, and many users won''t even drill down to the full description. Using HTML div and span tag attributes, this feature allows sellers to customize and fully control the short listing description that is displayed to prospective buyers when viewing the listing on a mobile device. The short listing description on mobile devices is limited to 800 characters, and whenever the full listing description (provided in this field, in UI, or seller tool) exceeds this limit, eBay uses a special algorithm to derive the best possible short listing description within the 800-character limit. However, due to some short listing description content being removed, it is definitely not ideal for the seller, and could lead to a bad buyer experience and possibly to a Significantly not as described (SNAD) case, since the buyer may not get complete details on the item when viewing the short listing description.

Note that an eBay Product ID (ePID) or a Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) value can be used in an attempt to find a matching product in the eBay Catalog. If a product match is found, the inventory item record will automatically pick up all product details associated with the eBay Catalog product. Many eBay categories will require at least one product identifier (a GTIN or a Brand/MPN pair). To discover which product identifier(s) that an eBay category might require or support, use the getItemAspectsForCategory method in the Taxonomy API. In the getItemAspectsForCategory response, look for product identifier names (brand, mpn, upc, ean, isbn) in the localizedAspectName fields, and then look for the correspondinng aspectRequired boolean fields as well as the corresponding aspectUsage field, which will indicate if the aspect is required, recommended, or optional. In some cases, a product identifier type may be required, but not known/applicable for a product. If this is the case, the seller must still include the corresponding field in the inventory item record, but pass in a default text string. This text string can vary by site, so the seller should use the GeteBayDetails call of the Trading API to get this string value. In the GeteBayDetails call, the seller should include a DetailName field with its value set to ProductDetails. In the response of the call, the seller can see the default string value in the ProductDetails.ProductIdentifierUnavailableText field. The seller will use this value in one or more of the product identifier fields (ean, isbn, upc, or mpn) if a product ID isn''t known or applicable. This container is not initially required, but it is required before an inventory item can be published as an offer, and/or if an inventory item is being updated and product data already exists for that inventory item. This container is always returned for published offers in the getInventoryItem, bulkGetInventoryItem, and getInventoryItems calls since product data must be defined for published offers, but for unpublished inventory items, this container will only be returned if product details have been defined for the inventory item.'

This field is not initially required when first creating an inventory item group, but will be required before the first offer of the group is published. Note: Since this description will ultimately become the listing description in a multiple-variation listing, the seller should omit the listingDescription field when creating the offers for each variation. If they include the listingDescription field for the individual offer(s) in an item group, the text in that field for a published offer will overwrite the text provided in this description field for the inventory item group. HTML tags and markup can be used in this field, but each character counts toward the max length limit. Note: To ensure that their short listing description is optimized when viewed on mobile devices, sellers should strongly consider using eBay''s View Item description summary feature when listing their items. Keep in mind that the ''short'' listing description is what prospective buyers first see when they view the listing on a mobile device. The ''full'' listing description is also available to mobile users when they click on the short listing description, but the full description is not automatically optimized for viewing in mobile devices, and many users won''t even drill down to the full description. Using HTML div and span tag attributes, this feature allows sellers to customize and fully control the short listing description that is displayed to prospective buyers when viewing the listing on a mobile device. The short listing description on mobile devices is limited to 800 characters, and whenever the full listing description (provided in this field, in UI, or seller tool) exceeds this limit, eBay uses a special algorithm to derive the best possible short listing description within the 800-character limit. However, due to some short listing description content being removed, it is definitely not ideal for the seller, and could lead to a bad buyer experience and possibly to a Significantly not as described (SNAD) case, since the buyer may not get complete details on the item when viewing the short listing description. See the eBay help page for more details on using the HTML div and span tags.

If successful, the response of the UploadSiteHostedPictures call will contain a full URL to the image on an eBay Picture Server. This is the URL that will be passed in through the imageUrls array. Before any offer can be published, at least one image must exist for the offer. Links to images can either be passed in through this imageUrls container, or they can be passed in through the product.imageUrls container when creating each inventory item in the group. If the variesBy.aspectsImageVariesBy field is used to specify the main product aspect where the variations vary, the links to the images must be passed in through this imageUrls container, and there should be a picture for each variation. So, if the variesBy.aspectsImageVariesBy field is set to Color, a link should be included to an image demonstrating each available color in the group.

Alternatively, sellers can view similar items on eBay.com in the same category to get an idea of what other sellers are using for product aspects/item specifics. Sellers also have the option of specifying an eBay Product ID (ePID) or optionally, a Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) through the corresponding fields in the product container in an attempt to find a product match in the eBay Catalog. If a match is found based on the ePID or GTIN value, the product aspects that are defined for the eBay Catalog product will automatically get picked up by the newly created/updated inventory item. Below is an example of the proper JSON syntax to use when manually inputting item specifics: &quot;aspects&quot;: {  &quot;Brand&quot;: [&quot;GoPro&quot;],  &quot;Storage Type&quot;: [&quot;Removable&quot;]  } Note that inventory items that will become part of an inventory item group and multiple-variation listing should have the same attributes that are defined for the inventory item group.

In this string field, the seller will specify the product aspect where the variations of the inventory item group vary, such as color. If Color is specified in this field, Color must also be one of the specifications.name values, and all available colors must appear in the corresponding specifications.values array.

This container is not immediately required, but will be required before the first offer of the inventory item group is published. If a product aspect is specified in the aspectsImageVariesBy container, this product aspect (along with all variations of that product aspect) must be included in the specifications container. Before offers related to the inventory item group are published, the product aspects and values specified through the specifications container should be in synch with the name-value pairs specified through the product.aspects containers of the inventory items contained in the group. For example, if Color and Size are in this specifications container, each inventory item of the group should also have Color and Size as aspect names in their inventory item records. This container is always returned if one or more offers associated with the inventory item group have been published. For inventory item groups that have yet to have any published offers, this container is only returned if set.'
